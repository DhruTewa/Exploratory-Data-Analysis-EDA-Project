## Problem Defination and Dataset

A csv file with a dataset from a research study where men & women walked for 90 minutes on a treadmill in a hot (35C) environment, 3 different times where only the relative humidity changed. Subjects completed trials at 55, 70, and 85% at the same walking speed and ambient temperature. Answer the questions below (#1-12) about what you see in the dataset.

## Questions

### Coding challenge:
1) Describe the dataset-- what do you notice about the dataset? Are there outliers, missing data, etc?
2) Would you remove any data or impute any values? If so, why?
3) Are any of the variables correlated? If so, why do you think that they are correlated physiologically- what might this tell you about people's responses to increasing relative humidty?
5) Are there are differences between males & females? If so, what are they? What do they mean within the context of this study, physiologically? (Feel free to run any statistical analyses here if you feel they are appropriate).
6) The MaxHR (maximum heart rate) is calculated for each subject, and it is based on their age-predicted max HR.
For each HR value (HR column), calculate that person's percent of their max HR. This is a rough estimate of how hard they are working. What can you infer about the work rate or intensity/effort in this study?
7) Are there differences between subjects' HR zones? What about differences across RH (relative humidity) or Time- the independent variables in this study?
Generally, at core temperatures exceeding 38.2C, we want to tell workers to stop working.
8) How many times did someone exceed 38.2C?
9) What other things can you tell me about the environmental conditions or their physiological responses at that time point? (i.e. what was the humidity, HR zone, skin temp, etc)?
10) Create a figure where you can best see how core temperature changes over time in men vs. women, but also at the 3 different relative humidities. What insights can be gained from this graph?
11) For each humidity, please analyze whether core temp is statistically different between men & women.
12) Do you notice anything else (physiological insights) or about the dataset that you think is important?
